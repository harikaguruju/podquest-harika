PodQuest is an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to make podcasts searchable by topic with precise timestamp references. It automatically converts podcast audio into accurate, time-aligned transcripts, indexes them in a vector database, and allows users to perform semantic search to find exactly where a topic was discussed across multiple episodes.

The system is built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface, Faster-Whisper for high-accuracy transcription, Sentence-Transformers for embeddings, and ChromaDB for efficient vector search.
